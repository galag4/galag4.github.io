### Hi :)

1. Vinyl Chase - rchase2@my.waketech.edu

2. I made this account for class, so I'll be using it to upload any assignments. I'm not 100% sure what counts as
a description of my account, so I hope that works(?).

3. This repository is for putting this README file on my profile, which I'm also doing for class. 

4. To clone the repository onto my computer, I downloaded Github Desktop, clicked "clone a repository", and chose 
a repository from my Github account to clone.
